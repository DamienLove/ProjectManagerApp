# Desktop App Guide

The **Omni Project Sync** desktop application is your command center for managing local and cloud projects.

## New Features (v4.7.0)

### ✅ Safer Defaults
- **Auto-Fill Remote Port**: Leaving the Remote Port blank now defaults to `8765`, preventing agent startup errors.

### 🔌 Better IDE Host + Terminal Flow
- **Unified Terminal Routing**: The Android terminal can route into open Android Studio terminals via the IDE plugin while keeping the system shell available.

### ✨ Quality-of-Life
- **Auto-Host Restarts**: When settings are saved, the remote agent restarts cleanly with updated config.

## Core Features
- **One-Click Sync**: "Activate" cloud projects to download them, or "Deactivate" local projects to offload them to the cloud.
- **Software Management**: Link specific installed apps to projects. The app can auto-uninstall software when it's no longer needed by any active project.
- **Portable Mode**: Run the entire suite from a USB drive or cloud folder.
