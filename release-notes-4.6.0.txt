## Highlights
- Sync UI: Installed Apps manager (map apps to projects, auto-uninstall when unused).
- Remote Agent: Cloudflare tunnel host auto-published to Firebase and saved to secrets.env.
- Android Studio plugin host: resolves public host from tunnel/env, avoids 127.0.0.1.
- Launchers: prefer packaged EXE (set USE_PYTHON=1 for source).

## Assets
- OmniProjectSync.exe, OmniRemoteAgent.exe / Portable, AndroidStudioPlugin.zip, OmniProjectRemote.apk, secrets.env.template
